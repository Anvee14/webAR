The basic syntax of the jQuery is: 
$(selector).action() 
$: The dollar symbol denotes the beginning of a jQuery function. 
selector: It is the id, tag name, class name of the HTML element that we want to select. 
action: It is a jQuery action that can be performed on the selected element, like, setting an attribute or hiding an element.
<span> tags are similar to <div> tags, but the only difference is that <span> tags are inline tags while <div> tags are block tags.
This means that if we use two <div> tags, it will be displayed in two different lines, but two <span> tags can be displayed side by side.
